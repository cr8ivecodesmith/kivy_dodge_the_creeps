Dodge the Creeps Kivy
=====================

Port of the Dodge the Creep game tutorial of the Godot Game Engine in Kivy.

I'm mostly doing this to learn Kivy and will probably be not 1:1 with the
Godot version since it's up to me to code everything game-specific.
For example, I utilized Kivy Atlas to implement animated sprites.

I'm picking up inspiration on how Godot implemented certain constructs needed
for it's game engine and trying to implement them in Kivy. You can find these
code under the `common` module.
